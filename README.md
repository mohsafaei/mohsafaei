## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## This is Mohammad Ali
ðŸ”¬ Researcher | Solid Mechanics | Smart Biomaterials

Passionate about the intersection of physics, engineering, and biomaterials, my journey began with a fascination for astronomy and evolved into a deep commitment to non-linear solid mechanics and smart materials. With a strong foundation in mechanical engineering and research experience in hydrogels and Dielectric Elastomer Actuators, I aim to contribute to the future of responsive biomaterials. My work focuses on integrating computational and experimental approaches to advance drug delivery systems and biomedical applications.
